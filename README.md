All experiments in Ch5 are conducted using the GreaNs Platform. Ch 5 contains network files evolved in the presence or absence of noise in the membrane potential of each neuron in the network using the GReaNs -platform

All experiments in Ch6 are conducted using the GreaNs Platform. Ch 6 contains network files evolved  in the presence of noise in the membrane potential of each neuron in the network, and variation of silence interval . 

Ch 7 contains network files of handcrafted network topologies, these topologies are optimized with EvoSNNs. The code for EvoSNNs is available on  https://github.com/yaqoobcs/evosnns
